abstract = {Abstract This article presents the results obtained using an unbiased Population Based Search (PBS) for optimizing Lennard–Jones clusters. PBS is able to repeatedly obtain all putative global minima, for Lennard–Jones clusters in the range 2 ≤ N ≤ 372, as reported in the Cambridge Cluster Database. The PBS algorithm incorporates and extends key techniques that have been developed in other Lennard–Jones optimization algorithms over the last decade. Of particular importance are the use of cut-and-paste operators, structure niching (using the cluster strain energy as a metric), two-phase local search, and a new operator, Directed Optimization, which extends the previous concept of directed mutation. In addition, PBS is able to operate in a parallel mode for optimizing larger clusters. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 26: 899–906, 2005}

abstract="A stochastic global optimization method is applied to the challenging problem of finding the minimum energy conformation of a cluster of identical atoms interacting through the Lennard-Jones potential. The method proposed incorporates within an already existing and quite successful method, monotonic basin hopping, a two-phase local search procedure which is capable of significantly enlarging the basin of attraction of the global optimum. The experiments reported confirm the considerable advantages of this approach, in particular for all those cases which are considered in the literature as the most challenging ones, namely 75, 98, 102 atoms. While being capable of discovering all putative global optima in the range considered, the method proposed improves by more than two orders of magnitude the speed and the percentage of success in finding the global optima of clusters of 75, 98, 102 atoms.",

abstract="A cluster is a group of identical molecules or atoms loosely bound by inter-atomic forces. The optimal geometry minimises the potential energy---usually modelled as the Lennard--Jones potential---of the cluster. The minimisation of the Lennard--Jones potential is a very difficult global optimisation problem with extremely many local minima. In addition to cluster problems, the Lennard--Jones potential represents an important component in many of the potential energy models used, for example, in protein folding, protein--peptide docking, and complex molecular conformation problems. In this paper, we study different modifications of the Lennard--Jones potential in order to improve the success rate of finding the global minimum of the original potential. The main interest of the paper is in nonsmooth penalised form of the Lennard--Jones potential. The preliminary numerical experiments confirm that the success rate of finding the global minimum is clearly improved when using the new formulae.",

abstract = {Abstract We compare three global configuration search methods on a scalable model problem to measure relative performance over a range of molecule sizes. Our model problem is a 2-D polymer composed of atoms connected by rigid rods in which all pairs of atoms interact via Lennard–Jones potentials. The global minimum energy can be calculated analytically. The search methods are all hybrids combining a global sampling algorithm with a local refinement technique. The sampling methods are simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA), and random search. Each of these uses a conjugate gradient (CG) routine to perform the local refinement. Both GA and SA perform progressively better relative to random search as the molecule size increases. We also test two other local refinement techniques in addition to CG, coupled to random search as the global method. These are simplex followed by CG and simplex followed by block-truncated Newton. For small problems, the addition of the intermediate simplex step improved the performance of the overall hybrid method. © 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}
