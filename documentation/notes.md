### Abstract

We use a newly-developed genetic algorithm to determine the lowest energy atomic
configurations of 2-100 atoms in the Lennard-Jones potential. Our method, which
contains no bias to specific symmetries, yields structures which are identical
to or are lower in energy than all previously published structures.
